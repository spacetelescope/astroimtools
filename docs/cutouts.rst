Cutout Helper Tools
===================

Cutout helper tools are useful for datasets from a large survey of
multiple sources, where there is a need to generate smaller cutout
images of interest.

Below is a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ illustrating how
to create cutout images of sources from a larger image.  You can also
download the notebook for your own use from the `astroimtools github
repository
<https://github.com/spacetelescope/astroimtools/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_:
