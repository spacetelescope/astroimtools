Reporting Issues and Contributing
=================================

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you have found a bug, please report it by creating
a new issue on the `astroimtools issue tracker
<https://github.com/spacetelescope/astroimtools/issues>`_. That requires
creating a `free Github account <https://github.com/>`_ if you do not
have one.

Please include an example that demonstrates the issue and will allow the
developers to reproduce and fix the problem. You may be also asked to
provide information about your operating system and a full Python stack
trace. The developers will walk you through obtaining a stack trace if
it is necessary.


Contributing
------------

Like the `Astropy`_ project, this package is made both by and for its
users. We accept contributions at all levels, spanning the gamut from
fixing a typo in the documentation to developing a major new feature. We
welcome contributors who will abide by the `Python Software Foundation
Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/>`_.

This package follows the same workflow and coding guidelines as
`Astropy`_. The following pages will help you get started with
contributing fixes, code, or documentation (no git or GitHub experience
necessary):

* `How to make a code contribution <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_

* `Coding Guidelines <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html>`_

* `Developer Documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/index.html>`_
